This includes things like 'vital signs such as body weight, blood pressure, and temperature […], personal characteristics such as eye-color […] social history like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status […]' ( https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html )\r\nFor some of these things, HL7 already has worked out profiles and they SHALL be used when such a use case is needed.
