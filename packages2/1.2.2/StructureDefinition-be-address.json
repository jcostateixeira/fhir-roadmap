In a KMEHR address, the use was defined by CD-ADDRESS but those values can be found in the FHIR valueset.\r\nKMEHR values 'careadress', 'other' and 'vacation' are not directly present in the FHIR address-use table but can be mapped to the value 'temp' in FHIR. In those cases, it is RECOMMENDED to also add a .period.\r\nIn KMEHR, an address might be expressed using free text or a totally structured approach where the streetname and housenumber are put in separate fields. FHIR prefers a more pragmatic approach where the ‘text’ element is used to print on labels. Also, streetname and number are not separate fields as in KMEHR but in a structural approach are given as one or moren ‘line’ elements. It is however RECOMMENDED to use the Streetname, Housenumber and Postbox extensions to express them seperately.\r\nNote the FHIR address also allows to optionally define whether the address is a physical, postal or ‘both’ address using the .type field."},{"id":"Address.extension","path":"Address.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"},"definition":"The Human Language of the item.
